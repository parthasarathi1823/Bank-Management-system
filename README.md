# Bank-Management-system
My first git repository.

Bank Management System (Python)
Project Overview

This is a menu-driven Bank Management System developed using Python with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The project simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, secure withdrawals, fund transfers, and viewing account details.
The objective of this project is to improve logic building, system design, and real-world problem modeling using Python.

Features :

Create a new bank account with a unique account number
Deposit money into an account
Withdraw money with PAN verification for security
Transfer money between two accounts
View complete account details
Menu-driven command-line interface
Input validation to prevent runtime errors
Security Implementation
PAN verification is mandatory for withdrawals
Prevents unauthorized access to accounts
Clear separation between user interface and banking logic

Language: Python

Concepts:
1.Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
2.Encapsulation
3.Class vs Instance Variables
4.Dictionary-based data storage
5.Control flow and input validation


How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/parthasarathi1823/Bank-Management-system.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd Bank-Management-System


Run the program:
python bank_management.py

Sample Menu
1. Create Account
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw (PAN Required)
4. Transfer
5. View Account Details
6. Exit

Learning Outcomes :
Practical understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in Python
Experience in designing a real-world system
Improved logical thinking and modular coding
Safe handling of user input and validations
Writing clean and maintainable code

Future Enhancements:
Transaction history for each account
File or database storage for persistent data
PIN or OTP-based authentication
Admin and user role separation
GUI or web-based version
